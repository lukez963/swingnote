#### Description
A note-taking app written in Java using Swing and Spring Boot. Currently only has basic functionality including creating, editing, and saving notes via Spring Data JPA and H2.

#### How to run
SwingNote requires Maven to run.
While in the root directory, run the command `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to run the application.
Alternatively, you can create an executable JAR file with the command `./mvnw clean package`, which will be created in the `target` subdirectory.
